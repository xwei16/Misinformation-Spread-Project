## CS 225 Data Structures 
### Team Contract (yifan20-xwei16-xianghe3-hanqing5) 
#### Communication 
1. **Team Meetings** 
    Our team will meet at least once a week at a given time in person or through Zoom, depending on each member’s time and convenience. The exact time and location of the next meeting will be decided at the end of the last meeting. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with hanqing5. Notes will be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting. The note-taker is also responsible for drafting the weekly DEVELOPMENT LOG entry, which is approved by the team at the start of the following week’s meeting. 
2. **Assistance** 
    Each team member can be contacted through Wechat, email, or Discord.   Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to Wechat messages and emails within 36 hours. 
3. **Respect** 
    The note-taker for the week will also serve as the ‘project lead’ for the weekly meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project. All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them. 
#### Collaboration 
1. **Work Distribution** 
   Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week and the deadline for the first draft will be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. Each week’s deliverable will be evaluated based on difficulty and other factors by our group members with the assistance of course staff. 
   When no one volunteers, two team members will be randomly assigned to work on the task as a paired-programming team. 
   If this leads to an unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments can be made on a case by case basis. 
2. **Time Commitment** 
    To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project. 
    If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforeseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or programming in pairs. Or, this team member will receive a lighter workload for the next week for the compensation. 
   And if workload is fair, each deliverable is expected to be completed prior to the weekly meeting. If one of the team members procrasted, the rest of team members will finish his/her work for that member and win the privilege to assign this member the proper extra task they want for the next week. During each meeting, individual works will be peer reviewed and concatenated. 
3. **Conflict Resolution** 
    All conflicts within the team will be discussed during the weekly meeting. Each member can express their opinions and provide logical arguments to convince other members. The final resolution will be determined by voting. Whoever gets the most votes will win.
